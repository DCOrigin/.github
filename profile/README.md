# Drift City Origin

*Drift City Origin* is a **non-commercial, fan-made emulator** for the latest Skid Rush client of the MMORPG *Drift City*.

## Background

*Drift City Origin* began as a **personal hobby project** in November 2019, created purely out of passion for the game. Its aim is to revive the *Stage 3* version (post-Neo City era) of *Drift City* for the European and English-speaking community. At the time, the only official servers still active were based in Korea (*Skid Rush*) and Japan (*Evolution*).

Since the shutdown of *Drift City Evolution* in May 2021, the Korean server remains the sole official version. Unfortunately, factors like a largely inactive player base, pay-to-win mechanics, a significant language barrier, and the requirement of a Korean ID for account creation have made access difficult for international fans. This highlights the value of an English-speaking, community-led revival of the game.

## Mission

We are building a **completely fan-driven emulator**, compatible with a more recent version of the *Skid Rush* client. Our goal is to eventually launch a **free, private server** to make the game accessible again for the community.

This is **strictly a passion project**, with **no commercial intent**. Our team—made up of volunteer developers, content creators, and long-time players—is committed to capturing the spirit of the original game while introducing fresh experiences for fans, old and new.
