# Drift City Origin

_Drift City Origin_ is an emulator for the latest Skid Rush Client of the MMORG Drift City.

## Background

Drift City Origin was launched as a hobby project in November 2019 with the intention to bring the _Stage 3_ version (post Neo City era) of the game back to the European and English speaking Drift City community, as the only active official servers at that time were based in Korea (_Skid Rush_) and Japan (_Evolution_).
Since Drift City Evolution shut down in May 2021, the only remaining official server is the Korean server.
Skid Rush's inactive community, pay-to-win orientation, the language barrier and, last but not least, the necessity of a Korean ID to create an account prevent a large part of the English speaking community from playing and emphasize the need for an English speaking server.

## Mission

We are developing a Drift City emulator that will be compatible with a recent version of the Skid Rush client.
Our ultimate goal is to open our own private Drift City server and release the game to the public.
One of our main challenges is to find a compromise between replicating the original game as we have come to love it and creating a new and exciting experience for the Drift City community.
We are working on this with a skilled and diverse team of developers, content creators, and players who are dedicated to creating the best possible game experience for you!
