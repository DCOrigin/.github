# Drift City Origin

Drift City Origin is an emulator for the latest Skid Rush Client of the MMORG Drift City.

## Background

_Origin_ was launched as a hobby project in November 2019 with the intention to bring the _Stage 3_ version (post Neo City era) of the game back to the European and English speaking Drift City community, as the only active official servers at that time were based in Korea (_Skid Rush_) and Japan (_Evolution_).
Since Drift City Evolution shut down in May 2021, the only remaining official server is the Korean server.
Skid Rush's inactive community, pay-to-win orientation, the language barrier and, last but not least, the necessity of a Korean ID to create an account prevent a large part of the English speaking community from playing and emphasize the need for an English speaking server.

## Mission

As a result, we at Origin are developing an emulator for the latest Skid Rush client from scratch, which we try to translate from Korean to English as far as possible.
Although the emulator aims to mimic the behavior of the original game as closely as possible, we still plan to change certain things.

Only to name a few:
* We will remove ST, BT and Mini Cars completely and adapt the car sizes such that all cars roughly have the same size
* GCoins can be bought with Mito and will be given out as reward for supporting the server on Patreon
* Rewards of certain game modes will vary from the original rewards (e.g. Rush Time, Under City, Neo City, etc.)
* New content will be added (e.g. to the Drift Shop)

Note that those adaptions are still subject to change in the future.
